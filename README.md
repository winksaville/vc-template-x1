<one paragraph: what this project is / status>

## Rust projects: seed Cargo.toml from CargoRust.toml

A Rust project scaffolded from this template should base its
`Cargo.toml` on [CargoRust.toml](CargoRust.toml). Adapt the
`[package]` fields freely; in particular keep the
`[lints.clippy]` section so `unwrap`/`expect` uses are visible
from the first commit — each site then needs an explicit
`#[allow]` + `// OK: …` justification (see AGENTS.md >
Code Conventions). The seed is not named `Cargo.toml` so this
template repo itself isn't mistaken for a cargo project.
(Drop this section when rewriting the README for the scaffolded
project.)
